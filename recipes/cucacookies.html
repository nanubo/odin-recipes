        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The cucas cookies are black, sweet cookies, which have a soft and slightly crunchy texture. They are ideal for enjoying a family afternoon accompanied by a good glass of cold milk; I believe that there is no better pleasure than that, to enjoy this delicacy and accompanied by the people we love most.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>½ cup of water</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon of baking soda.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Sift the flour, and mix with the cup of syrup, ground ginger, cinnamon, butter, and baking soda, mix well to form a dough, but without kneading too much.</li>
            <li>With the oil, grease a metal baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Perform the same procedure with the rest of the dough, being careful not to gather them much on the tray, as these cookies grow.</li>

            <li>Take them out of the oven, take the cookies off the tray, and fresh.</li>
